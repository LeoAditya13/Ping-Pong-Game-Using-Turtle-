# Ping Pong Game 
Welcome to the Ping Pong Game project, a classic arcade game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library.

# Overview
This project recreates the iconic Ping Pong game where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen. It is built using Python's Turtle module for graphics and interactive gameplay.

# Features
Interactive Gameplay: Players control paddles using keyboard input to hit the ball and score points.
Score Tracking: Keeps track of player scores and updates them dynamically during gameplay.
Collision Detection: Implements collision detection between the ball, paddles, and game boundaries.
Customizable Settings: Adjustable game speed, paddle size, and ball speed to accommodate different skill levels.

# How It Works
Turtle Graphics: Utilizes the Turtle module to create graphical elements such as paddles, ball, and game boundaries.

Game Mechanics: Implements game logic including ball movement, paddle controls, and collision handling.

User Interaction: Players control the game using keyboard inputs (e.g., arrow keys) to move paddles and interact with the game.

# Usage
To play the Ping Pong Game:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure Python and the Turtle library are installed on your system.
Run the Python script (main.py) to start the game.
Use arrow keys (or specified keys) to move paddles and hit the ball.
Score points by successfully hitting the ball past your opponent's paddle.

# Future Enhancements
AI Opponent: Implement an AI-controlled opponent for single-player mode.
Multiplayer Support: Add multiplayer functionality to allow two players to compete locally or over a network.
Enhanced Graphics: Improve visuals with additional animations and effects.
